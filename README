This program is run with the command java Game.java

the minimax function can be found in Board.java as "public double minimax()"
it uses alpha beta pruning in a min max tree and recursively calls itself, it takes in
a depth subtracts 1 from it for each recursion. It returns the evaluation of the
board after each move is tested. It attempts to find the best move by searching the
tree for the minimum value (for black) or the maximum value (for white), there is
further explanation in the comments of the function.










the class files are generated with
"javac -d . Game.java Board.java Square.java Piece.java Pawn.java
Queen.java King.java Rook.java Bishop.java Knight.java Check.java Move.java"
but they should already be there.
